1 - truncate the EDW (put instructions on how)

1.5 - add "0 rows" to the dimension tables (and fact tables?)
	--find out how later....


1 - Put function in edwmgr schema that converts multi_source_key to mif_value
2 - add virtual column to every fact, freeze, and aggregate table
3 - modify mappings
	a) wdt_warehouse_entity: cartesian it to GTVVPDI
	b) All dimenson *_Person mappings (in finaid, general, and student). Alter user_attribute_01 to yes, no, no, yes to work for merges
	c) some wkeys mappings need work when we are dealing with an un-mep'd table, such as mst_test
4 - modify every extract package, set all user_attribute_01 values = ret_row.multi_source
	make sure you don't modify any user_measure_01 fields
	this has to be done manually, all the user_attribute_01 fields have different names

	also alter every join to wdt_warehouse_entity for mepped ODS tables, adding a user_attribute_01 = mif_value join
	However, when the ODS table is not mepped, need to switch the selected value from the soure table (which will be null) to the 
	wdt_warehouse_entity value (which will not be null)

5 - set the cleansing rules = to multi_source for each of these:

update mgrcdim
   set mgrcdim_cleansing_rule_name = 'MULTI_SOURCE', mgrcdim_cleansing_ind = 1
 where mgrcdim_column_name = 'USER_ATTRIBUTE_01'


6 - modify all constraints/indexes

7 - reload the EDW
