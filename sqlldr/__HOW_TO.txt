here is how to run in LINUX:

1) create temp tables in odsd.ia_admin schema with all the fields you will need
2) delete header row from the CSV file(s)
3) create control file - similar to load.ctl
4) upload control file & data files to LINUX server wherever you'd like (the first time I used \dw01\temp\sqlldr directory
 that I made, and subsequenly deleted ... this is fine, just remember to delete it from server when done)
4) log onto LINUX server adn do the following to set up the environment

[oracle@tstodsdb01 ~]$ . oraenv
ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? ODSD
 [oracle@tstodsdb01 ~]$ echo $ORACLE_SID
ODSD
[oracle@tstodsdb01 ~]$ echo $ORACLE_HOME
/dw01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0

5) Issue the following command:

sqlldr userid=ia_admin/***** control=/dw01/temp/sqlldr/load.ctl  log=/dw01/temp/sqlldr/load.txt

This should load - if there are errors, fix them.

6) when done with the data, delete temp tables from database
7) when done with the data, delete the temp files from LINUX server
